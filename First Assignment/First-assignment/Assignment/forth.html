    <h1>Computer Basics</h1>
    <p>

        A computer is an electronic device that performs a wide range of tasks by executing programmed instructions. It
        consists of hardware components such as a <i>central processing unit</i> <b>CPU,</b> <i>memory, storage devices,
            input/output devices,</i> and a <i>motherboard</i> that connects and manages these components. The
        <b>CPU</b> is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
        Memory stores data and instructions temporarily, while storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state
        drives, hold data for long-term use.
    </p>
    <h1>Devices</h1>
    <p>Input/output devices allow users to interact with the computer by providing <i>input</i>, such as <b>Keyboards,
            Mouse</b> and <b>mice</b>, and <i>output</i>, such as <b>monitors</b> and <b>printers</b>. Computers can run
        various operating systems and software applications, enabling users to perform tasks like <i>word processing,
            web browsing, gaming,</i> and <i><b>much more</b></i>. With advancements in technology, computers have
        become smaller, faster, and more powerful, revolutionizing industries, enhancing communication, and transforming
        the way we live and work.</p>
