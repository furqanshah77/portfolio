    <h1>Mineral Water</h1>
    <p><b>Mineral water</b> refers to bottled <b> water</b> that naturally contains minerals and trace elements derived
        from its
        source. It is different from <i>tap <b> water</b> or purified water</i>, as it retains the <i>naturally
            occurring
            minerals present in the <b>water </b>source.</i></p>
