    <h1>Nihari</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Nihari</b> is a popular and flavorful slow-cooked stew that is widely enjoyed in Pakistan. It is a rich and
        hearty dish known for its tender meat, aromatic spices, and thick gravy. <b>Nihari</b> is typically made with
        <i>beef or mutton, </i>which is simmered for hours to achieve a <u>melt-in-your-mouth </u>texture and
        develop a robust flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name <b>"Nihari"</b> is derived from the Arabic word <u>"Nahar,"</u> which means <i>"morning."</i>
        Traditionally, <b>Nihari</b> was prepared overnight and consumed as a nourishing <i>breakfast</i> to provide energy for
        the day. However, it is now enjoyed throughout the day as a filling and indulgent meal.
